# liri-node-app
## Liri is a CLI built with node.js made by me, *Preston Powell*

Liri was a lot of fun to build. It was my first real experience with node.js and NPM and when I started building it I had a very minimal understanding and used the npm docs to learn how to build this. I got to learn about different packages and how to begin to write backend code. I used several node packages including: Spotify, Request, Twitter, Dotenv, and more, I also learned about using node's built-in filesystem package to create, read and update files. Liri demosnstrates my ability to use node, parse through data, understand NPM documentation, and create CLI's using process.argv.

### Functions:

1. **Spotify**
  * Calls The Spotify API using a node package for Spotify
  * Returns Information About Any Song You Request including artist, year, name, and even gives a preview.
  * If no query is entered it reads a file and automatically displays a preset song.
  
2. **Twittter**
  * Twitter Calls the Twitter API using a node Package.
  * The twitter-this command returns my 10 most recent tweets and the times they were posted.

3. **OMDB**
  * OMDB uses request to make a call to the OMDB movie API
  * The command movie-this followed by the movie name returns the title, actors, plot, and a few other things about a movie.
  * If no movie name is entered it searches for a default movie I picked.
  
*liri has a few more fun things it can do so go ahead and clone the repo and see what it can do. Feel free to contribute or make any suggestions on improvements*

## Future Improvements

I doubt I will do any further updates to this application, but if I did I would make a front-end web app wit  a fun user interface. THe reason I probably won't, is because I can't think of too many times where people would need info on songs movies, and a random twitter account in the same place.
